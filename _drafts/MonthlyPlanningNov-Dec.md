Its October 24th, I reserved a day for Month Planning. I had things planned for today which I think will not happen.  Since there is a vacation coming up in November I thought to plan ahead till end of November and end October.  What this means is unfinished tasks will be carried over and new goals will be entered.

# 4.Time to Market vs Time in Hand - Reality Check

### Scenario One - Start selling with only two apps in portfolio

**Time to Market** :  21 weeks

### Scenario Two  - Start selling with one app in portfolio

**Time to Market** : 16 weeks

Scenario two wins because it seems to be the leanest way to figure out if I am market ready.  Should be able to showcase that I have learned in this space and demonstrate. 

4 months is big number**.  What can be done to achieve 4 months of work in 3 m.  What can be done to achieve 4 months of work in 3 monthsonths**. 

1. Increase FOCUS.

2. IDEAS : Radhika going to Kanpur in Dec, will increase focus.

3. Sit in a closed room and dont think of outside world.

4. What is the output of Interaction Design course- Is it really contributing - Ask in forums.  Interaction design is seven week course. If things can be done in parallel than it could be halved. On the other hand Design thinking and portfolio building is happening simultaneously.  There are high chances that Design thinking is beyond estimate.  I dont want to take a risk of Design thinking certification to get hurt.

   TODO:

   1. Already posted this as a question, waiting for response.
