I had specific goals for last week i.e. 44. 

1. Recruit people for Empathy phase
2. Redesign this blog
3. Blogging - What and Why of UX Design.

I have recruited three out of 5 people for Empathy phase, redesigning of blog is done and task# 3 spilled over to this week and I finished writing the blog post.  

What's up for Week # 45.

1. Interviews and Probing kit assessment
2. Blogging 

At this point I am clear what needs to be done for Interviews and handing over the probing kit.  I guess probing kit will spill to next week.  The last blog post which was about UX Design for business went very well.  Probably I should do a video about it in future.  

If I have to write next part about it than it should be :  How to Start with User Experience.  At this point I don't clarity on what would be the title of blog post.   The idea is of any one has understood my first post than it should guide to them to UX process in next process.  Here is the outline I can think of:

1. Start with connection to previous blog post 
2. What is UX Design process
3. Can you fail in UX Design process

The idea behind writing is that I can think my service offering from customer 's point of view.  Why will a customer invest in UX design process? What if UX design process fail? 

Questions like these should help me craft out my next blog post. For week # 45 my Primary goal will be to focus on Empathy phase and if there is a remaining time than secondary goal i.e. blog post on UX Design Process.
