So I didn't write down weekly post for 42. As I mentioned in the weekly post for week # 41  I ended up completing a chapter of design thinking i.e. Empathy phase from interaction-design.org.

Now the blog is up and running so I thought to recap week # 42 and share what's the plan for week # 43. Week # 42 went fantastic and definitely, a great plan is coming up for next month. The best part about current and last week is blogging.  During my writings, I discovered that lot of things which I never planned slipped in and I started doing that.  When this realization came this made me focus on things that I planned. 

When the month started I had no idea how much capacity I have and how much should I plan.  There were failures and success during monthly planning. For week # 43 I will be entirely focusing on house repair works, drawing and blogging. 

One of the areas that I have never talked about in my blog is focussing on Body.  I was overweight for the last 3 years and a doctor also advised to cut down by 10 kgs for a healthy life.  My last two years at work were so crazy in work that I ended up gaining a lot of weight.  

This is the time to beat the devil. I have become a fan of putting up measurable goals and working towards it.  For this month I have achieved 50% of my goal and I feel that's the max I can achieve. I started reading this book.

There were mistakes I made this month however I kept following the plan.  Some of the doubts around carbohydrates and cholesterol management got cleared. 

The reason why I am saying that it's important to focus and start from the body is:

**#1**. When the body opens up there are new possibilities -  My body was not flexible and I have had a hard time cleaning my house.  Which means depending on someone else or maybe ending up paying money to get things done.

**#2**. The connection between Body and Mind - There is a connection between body and mind that one has to discover themselves.  Once the body is fit it brings a lot of positivity and creativity in a way one thinks.

**#3**. Start with Body is easy to say and difficult to fulfil - I still remember that when I got out of my job my first focus area was on organizing the house.  I worked hard towards designing the house in such a way that daily chores take less time. Fewer interruptions especially during the morning hours when I am working.  Even though I was playing badminton I didn't pay attention to the body in the beginning.  I still remember that I hired a couple of nutritionists and ended up not taking services from them.  I guess that's the hardest thing in the world, to find someone who can create a diet plan according to your lifestyle.  So I was on a journey towards working on Body but it took me a while to find "4-hour body book".  I don't know if 4-hour body book is for everyone but I am getting good results especially from diet mentioned in the book. 

Once again Diet is one of the areas that I haven't learnt and most of the problem starts from there.  The body comes before work.  The kind of life we live is mostly focused on chasing money.  When one starts living this way, everybody around you will say that make money first then think of something else.  That's a sad reality.  I have reached a situation that when people around me are saying NO to anything I am doing, for me it translates to I am going in the right direction.  

Believing in yourself and doing things, and having a mindset of failing and recovering is a skill that one learns from experiences in life.  Not an expert but still learning it.

Let's keep rocking.
