It's been a real long time since I've posted any content on my blog - it's been over a full year. 

A lot has changed over the past year, during which I took my previous blog offline. My primary reason for this was I knew that my ability to post and update the site and associated server were very limited. Had I not taken it down I can almost guarantee that the site would have been compromised, if it wasn't already before I took it down. It previously ran on WordPress, which is a gravitational force field for vulnerabilities due to the large number of sites using it.

## Why are we back?
We're back because I like to learn, and I like to teach people what I learn.

Oh, and we're using **Jekyll** this time!

## What are we going to be covering?
Everything.

Seriously. I like to learn everything, but a brief overview of the minimum topics we'll be covering within the next year or so:
+ Azure AD and Office 365
+ Amazon Web Services (AWS)
+ Microsoft Azure
+ Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
+ Automation - using Python, Ansible, Terraform, CloudFormation, and PowerShell. Not all at once.
+ Basic IT Concepts - remembering how things work.

## What's the timeline?
Well, whenever I get the time I'll post something.

Seriously though, in about 2 weeks I'll have this first post done.

## Whats the first post going to be?
#### Microsoft Azure Import/Export Service
I recently imported about 4TB worth of data using Azure Import/Export service, and I wrote a post along the way to help others that might be interested.

I'm a little disappointed in the level of service I received from Azure, which is something you'll see I made very clear in the post.

A full month from the date they received my drive to when they actually completed the import - take from that what you will, for now.
