This blog post describes the background context for a software tool called 'g2p' which is shorthand for 'Grapheme-to-Phoneme', but if you don't know those terms, don't worry, this post will explain it. Essentially, it is a tool for converting between two types of text, whether you want to convert between a [writing system and the phonetic alphabet](#use-case-1-getting-the-pronunciation-from-a-words-spelling), between two [writing systems for the same language](use-case-2-a-language-with-multiple-writing-systems), or between a legacy ['font-hacked' writing system and its current Unicode-supported version](use-case-3-converting-from-legacy-writing-systems).

# What are the motivations behind this project/technology/tip?

There are many reasons why you might want to systematically convert between different 'letters' referred to in computer science typically as 'characters'. Here are a few use cases:


### Use Case #1: Getting the pronunciation from a word's spelling

Sometimes you want to convert between a language's writing system (also known as *orthography*) and its pronunciation. "Letters" in a writing system are usually referred to as "graphemes" and their corresponding meaningful sounds are referred to as "phonemes"; hence "g2p" or "grapheme-to-phoneme". 

It gets a little more complicated than that though, because sometimes a grapheme is made of more than one character, as in "th" which can be pronounced *[unvoiced](https://www.thoughtco.com/voiced-and-voiceless-consonants-1212092#:~:text=Voiceless%20consonants%20do%20not%20use,as%20in%20%22thing%22).)* as in 'thin' or *[voiced](https://www.thoughtco.com/voiced-and-voiceless-consonants-1212092#:~:text=Voiced%20Consonants,-Your%20vocal%20cords&text=As%20you%20pronounce%20a%20letter,W%2C%20Y%2C%20and%20Z.)* as in 'that'. 

The [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) is not so ambiguous, and writes the 'th' in 'thin' as **θ** and the 'th' in 'that' as **ð**. Knowing how to convert between the written and spoken form of a language is useful in a variety of computational tasks, but I will describe the usefulness specifically with a project called "ReadAlongs" [below](#readalongs)

### Use Case #2: A language with multiple writing systems

Some languages have two (or more!) different writing systems. Take Cree for example, where you can either write a word in *Standard Roman Orthography* like "ê-wêpâpîhkêwêpinamâhk" or in *Syllabics* like **ᐁᐍᐹᐲᐦᑫᐍᐱᐊᒫᕽ**. My colleague [Eddie](https:://eddieanotonio.ca) has a great blog post about a tool he created to convert between the two [here]({{ "why-a-new-cree-syllabics-converter" | absolute_url }}).

### Use Case #3: Converting from legacy writing systems

Some languages historically used 'font hacks' to render the characters in their writing system before they were supported standardly on computers. There's a longer discussion to be had here, but the coles' notes version is that when computers were gaining popularity, they weren't typically able to *render* (ie display) characters outside of the 128 characters supported by the [American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). To get around this, language communities would come up with their own custom fonts (often referred to as 'font hacks' or 'font encodings') where they would render things characters like '©' which existed in ASCII as 'ǧ' instead (example taken from the Heiltsuk Doulos font). For more information on this topic, please check out ['Seeing the Heiltsuk Orthography from Font Encoding through to Unicode'](http://aidanpine.ca/static/cv/pdfs/Pine-Turin-Convertextract-2018.pdf) or ['Applications and innovations in typeface design for North American Indigenous languages'](https://markturin.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2020/06/Schillo_Turin_typeface_2020.pdf).
