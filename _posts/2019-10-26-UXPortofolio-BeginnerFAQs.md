![BeginnerQuestions]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/beginnerquestions.jpg)

Since this is going to be my first portfolio, as a beginner I had following questions. Most of the answers are from training available on interaction-design.org and some of them are from questions asked on UXDesign Community on reddit. I can not guarantee correctness of these answers but this is something I came into agreement with. Does your answer differ?*

## <u>FAQ</u>

#### 1. What is UX Portfolio.  

A documented case study.

#### 2. What is the most Essential Skill required.

Writing.  

#### 3. Who is the target audience.

Recruiters.

#### 4. What does Portfolio showcases.

Thinking, Technical and Communication skills.

#### 5. What is the preferred methodology for developing Portfolio: 

Basics of design thinking.

#### 6. UX Generalist or Specialist?

   **Long Answer:**

   When designing a portfolio it could be a difficult for a beginner to decide where they are good at. 

   These are the specialised roles that exist :

   1. User Research
   2. Interaction Design
   3. Information Architecture
   4. Usability Testing
   5.  Visual Design
   6. Front end development.  

   I was listening to interview from [Daniel Rosenberg](https://www.interaction-design.org/daniel_rosenberg) who is a pro in  UX and according to him no one can do all the things.  The fundamental reason behind that is you get biased.  For e.g. If you are doing Usability Testing you will be biased at your own design.  This is why UX work is done in a team.  One should rotate between different roles and specialise in one of them.  That's an advice from Daniel.

   Listening to Daniel I would say for a beginner and speaking with the senior UX designer at Adobe it seems best way to deal would be to have a basic of everything and stress on what you are specialized good at.

**Short Answer :** As a beginner you cant predict where will you land up, its better to start as generalist and later decide if you have an inclination towards specialisation. 

#### 7. What should be format of Portfolio:

   Website.

#### 8. What should be focus area in Portfolio.

  Its **not the end result** its *Demonstrating Process in Case Study*

#### 9. Can portfolio contain work done while pursuing education.

No.

#### 10. While pursuing education in UX, I am doing case studies as part of it. How can I make it part of portfolio?s

TODO : Still looking for an answer for this.
