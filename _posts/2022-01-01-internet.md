Greenage has Gigabit Internet with Fiber to Home (FTH) serviced by [Act Fibernet](https://www.actcorp.in), [Airtel](https://www.airtel.in), [Jio](https://www.jio.com), and [Tata Sky](https://www.tatasky.com).

Once you apply to any of the Internet Service Providers (ISP), they will do the installation based off your needs. All towers in Greenage are equiped and ready for any of the providers. A flat can have one or more Internet connections.

All flats in Greenage are, by default, wired with either Cat 5e[^cat5e] or Cat 6[^cat6] cables. Wherever possible, it is advisable to use a wired connection as they are always faster and reliable than Wi-Fi connections. For details on how to leverage the cables, consult the Greenage electricians as they are well equiped and well verse in the cable systems in all flats in Greenage.

## Wi-Fi

Be aware that any Wi-Fi router that you used will have its signal limited due to the thick cement walls in Greenage. You are advised to use wi-fi or LAN extenders (preferred as you already have cables inside), or invest in a wi-fi mesh system. The thoroughput and function of your [Wi-Fi](https://oinam.fyi/technology/wi-fi/) signal will depend on the types, and spects of the routers you choose.

[^cat6]: [Category 6 cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_6_cable) (Cat 6) is a standardized twisted pair cable for Ethernet and other network physical layers that is backward compatible with the Category 5/5e and Category 3 cable standards.
