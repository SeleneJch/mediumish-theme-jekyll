<p> Salarpuria Greenage is a residential complex on Hosur Road in Bengaluru. We are a short distance away from Koramangala and HSR Layout. The complex is located next to Oxford College and also an upcoming metro station on RV Road - Bommasandra 'Yellow line'. 
  
We are a community of 1676 flats, grouped into 10 Towers/Blocks. About 70% of the total area is open spaces with a lot of walking paths, sitting areas and green cover. 

There are 2BHK, 3BHK and 4BHK (Bedroom, Hall, Kitchen) flats with varying sizes and layouts, thus offering something that fits everyone's needs.
