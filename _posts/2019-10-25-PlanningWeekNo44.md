So here is the plan for this week:
where
**#1.** Training - Become UX Designer from Scratch

**#2.** Blogging

**#3.** Redesign this Blog 

## Training - Become UX Designer from Scratch

I have already completed lesson 1 (What is UX ) and 2 (what to UX Designers Do) and I took notes also. Makes me the question that since week # 45 will be on the empathise phase of design thinking, when will I be taking interviews? Lesson five is all about portfolio creation.  I guess I should start from lesson 5 because the portfolio is the only goal till week # 52. 

Lesson # 52 looks good, it seems once I have gone through it I will have a clear understanding on:

1. How to build a UX portfolio?
2. What assignment I need to build my portfolio.  
3. Questions like: Do I need a live project? Do I need a team etc

Let's spend one full day with Lesson # 52 and see where it takes us. This should be tackled earlier in the week. 

## Blogging

I am writing my journey but I think its time to blogs about core UX stuff. Things that I have learned.  So the whole idea is that I can have two blogs.  One of the company blog and other is this one.  What I post here can be cross-posted to company blog in future.  Here are two blog posts which I think will be good :

#1. What is UX Design?

#2. Why UX Design?

#3 UX Deliverables (Optional)

By writing this I am also getting prepared for sales.  This should help me practice how I can convince a startup owner to pursue UX design. 

## Redesign Blog

Here are the goals for redesigning this blog:

1. Decide where Portfolio site to be hosted.  Can it live on the root of my existing Github account? Lesson # 5 should help to gain clarity.

2. Redesign Goals: MySecondLife:

   a. Photos should take precedence

   b. Better font

   c. Medium Styled

   d. Responsiveness

   

## Is this Attainable Goal for Week?

In priority order, the UX Portfolio is the highest priority. Lets reserve two days for it. Blogging is a good self-investment I don't mind spending 1.5-day writing blog posts above.  Redesigning of Blog shouldn't take more than one day.  The shortest path to do this will find a free theme which meets my need and implement it. If it doesn't work then continue with whatever I have now. 

Ok, I am set with plan and order to tackle as well. Let's keep going.
