The picture above summarizes business and sweet spot of success.  Let's break it down:

1. Desirability - Wished for being useful.

2. Viability - Ability to work successfully

3. Feasibility - The state of being easily or conveniently done

   **Desirability** is the human aspect of a business, are we creating a product solution that anyone needs or meets an unfulfilled need? **Viability** is the business model behind the product which helps to sustain and **Feasibility** is tech behind it.dont

   To put it simple words one may have a desire to travel to Europe for vacation.  To fulfil this desire we need Money and Carrier (aeroplane/ship).  Money answers the feasibility aspect, only if we have money than we can plan the trip.  The trip will be viable only if air tickets are available to travel to Europe.

Why do most startups fail?  I am certainly not an expert in this area but if we listen to experts like Paul Graham, founder of YCombinator which is an incubator and resulted in startups like Airbnb, Stripe, Dropbox and lot more. 

> "There's just one mistake that kills startups: not making something users want. If you make something users want, you'll probably be fine, whatever else you do or don't do. And if you don't make something users want, then you're dead, whatever else you do or don't do."

This leads to the question of how can startups make something that user desires.  If we have to answer this question than I would think more about the problem than the solution.  

**What are obstructions that are preventing to create a solution that customer wants.**  

It's a known devil and a friend: Technology.  Technology is both a friend and foe.  I will focus on why its a foe because our society has been conditioned to invest in engineering.  In engineering what gets taught is technology i.e. Microprocessors, RAM.  With such a technology-oriented mindset when engineers join businesses they start from technology and go all the way up to creating a product or solution.  

A tech company is conditioned to think from the perspective of what technology can offer not what the user wants.  Steve Jobs has reasoned success behind Apple brand:

> **'You've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You can't start with the technology and try to figure out where can I sell it.' Steve Jobs**

There are a lot more obstructions but this is the root cause of the problem.   I have worked in tech for more than a decade and I strongly advocate to not to start a company by hiring engineers.  Start with people who care about needs, people who are deeply interested in knowing about customers.  

If we have to start from customer experience than how can we do that?  For a person who is starting a business, he will not be impressed by this idea because it creates a chicken :chicken: and egg :egg: problem.  We want to build a product but we haven't shipped anything. Where to start from? What will I show to my customer?

I will cover this in my next post.
