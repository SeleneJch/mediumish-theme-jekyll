How is the week going?

Goals are clear and working towards them. 

I rewrote the goals for this week so that I have enough clarity.

![Revised Week 44]({site.baseurl}/assets/images/week44redited.jpg)

At this point I have enough clarity about Redesign and Blogging goals but executing empathy phase doesn't look easy.  Here are the blockers:

#1. Getting into personal relations to get things done.

#2. Icebreaker - Some of the people I know well, some just a little bit.  Its tough to break the ice.

#3. It feels tough to deal with people who are in mid 30's. 

What is it I am trying to accomplish:

1. Recruit people who cant exercise enough
2. Give them a probe kit and they will follow it.

I think getting an interview is not hard.  Asking people to execute tasks based on probing kit can be hard. I think that' the tough part of getting things done in personal space.  Tough but not impossible.

So what do I need?

People close enough who dont mind lending an extended hand.  Let me list out initials of people:

1. A

2. R

3. P

   That's all I got when I look at people around me. So I need one person outside comfort zone, and in case that person doesn't turn up a backup for him/her.

4. Vi

5. Va

6. Ne

   So I got three more which makes it six.  So I should reach out to all the six and set the expectations.  I feel a phone call will be the best way to reach a person. What should be my script?

   > "Hi, How are you"?
   >
   > "**IceBreaker** - Appreciate the person -  Its good to start with positive note"
   >
   > **"Share : I need help and this is what you can do for me"** - A case study as part of education curriculum.  My goal is to document the case study which will become part of my portfolio.  Portfolio is going to be a website, most likely. Portfolio will be used to find work. Case study is about people who are not able to exercise enough and carry a mobile phone. 
   >
   > **Talk about Personal Data collection** - Photo (uploaded), Audio recording (not uploaded)" and data collected from Interview.  Talk about what will be done with data.
   >
   > **Ask them for permission** - Are you willing to participate in it?  I don't mind if you turn this down and it will not have any impact on personal relationship.
   >
   > **Setup the date time for interview.** 
   >
   > **Close the call.**

This looks cool?

There is more to it:

I feel it can be too much for a person to take this much information. The purpose I have is "I need help" and this is what you can do for me.  Does that sound humble?

Sunday seems to be the best day to call people and go forward.  Until then I can prepare my probe kit.
