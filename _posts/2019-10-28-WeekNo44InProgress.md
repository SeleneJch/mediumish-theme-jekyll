There is a jungle out there and I am trying to find the shortest path to get out of it.   Fun is not in the end result, the fun is in discovering how to get out of it. 

In today's world with wealth of information available it makes our decision making slow, also there is not guarantee that you will stick to your decisions and do what you have decided.

When I look book at my previous posts, I can see how I made simple things complex.  My planning system was too complex it involved lot of will power.  This could be sole reason that I didn't like my own planning system.  

Lets focus on week # 44 activities. There were three focus areas

**#1.** Portfolio creation.

**#2.** Redesigning Blog.

**#3.** Writing Blog.

In my last blog post I set up three goals for Portfolio Creation

1. How to build UX portfolio
2. What assignment I need to build my portfolio.  
3. Questions like : Do I need live project? Do i need a team etc

As per my understanding UX portfolio is collection of case studies executed for professional work. This creates a chicken and egg problem.  Currently I don't have a professional work, can I get from outside?

If I go outside, who will give me work?  This is classical chicken and egg problem which exist in every discipline.  The best way to deal this would be do act confident in this situation. Yes Confident, start talking like a UX Designer.

I guess best way to deal would be to do couple of case studies which are a part of course curriculum, document them mentioning they are a part of education.  Once the homework is done, than go out and find real work which will lead to portfolio making.  

For me this is a call to action, step out of house.  Interview people and focus on core UX work.  

Lastly here is short update on #2 i.e. Redesign blog.  I found a theme to redesign this blog, its call [mediumish](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll).  I did a test run of it this weekend and it looks great.  Its bundled with lot of features (GoogleAnalytics, Disqus comments, Hero Images and lot more) I wanted.   At this time it's not highest in priority so I spent one pomodoro in prioritising whats the most important using [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method.

Am really excited about how blog is coming up, its surely a way to reflect on myself.

NEXT STEPS:

Start executing next week plan this week i.e. start with case studies part of IDF curriculum.
