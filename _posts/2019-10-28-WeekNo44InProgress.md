There is a jungle out there and I am trying to find the shortest path to get out of it.   Fun is not in the result, the fun is in discovering how to get out of it. 

In today's world with a wealth of information available, it makes our decision making slow, also there is no guarantee that you will stick to your decisions and do what you have decided.

When I look book at my previous posts, I can see how I made simple things complex.  My planning system was too complex it involved a lot of will power.  This could be the sole reason that I didn't adhere to my planning system.  

Let's focus on week # 44 activities. There were three focus areas

**#1.** Portfolio creation.

**#2.** Redesigning Blog.

**#3.** Writing Blog.

In my last blog post, I set up three goals for Portfolio Creation

1. How to build a UX portfolio
2. What assignment I need to build my portfolio.  
3. Questions like: Do I need a live project? Do I need a team etc

As per my understanding, a UX portfolio is a collection of case studies executed for professional work. This creates a chicken and egg problem.  Currently, I don't have a professional job, can I get case studies from outside?

If I go outside, who will give me work?  This is a classic chicken and egg problem which exist in every discipline.  The best way to deal this would be to act confidently in this situation and execute what needs to be done. Yes Confident, start talking like a UX Designer.

I guess the best way to deal would be to do a couple of case studies which are a part of the course curriculum, document them mentioning they are a part of education.  Once the homework is done then go out and find real work which will lead to portfolio making.  

For me this is a call to action, step out of the house.  Interview people and focus on core UX work.  

Lastly here is a short update on #2 i.e. Redesign blog.  I found a theme to redesign this blog, its call [mediumish](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll).  I did a test run of it this weekend and it looks great.  Its bundled with a lot of features (GoogleAnalytics, Disqus comments, Hero Images and lot more) I wanted.   At this time it's not highest in priority so I spent one Pomodoro in prioritising what's the most important using [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method.

Am excited about how the blog is coming up, it's surely a way to reflect on myself.

NEXT STEPS:

Start executing next week plan this week i.e. start with case studies part of IDF curriculum.
